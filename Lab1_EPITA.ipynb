        "Keyword extraction is defined as the task that automatically identifies a set of the terms that best describe the subject of document. This is an important method in information retrieval (IR) systems: keywords simplify and speed up the search. Keyword extraction can be used to reduce the dimensionality of text for further text analysis (text classification or topic modeling). S.Art et al., for example, extracted keywords to measure patent similarity. Using keyword extraction, you can automatically index data, summarize a text, or generate tag clouds with the most representative keywords."

Then we will use TruncatedSVD to compute 2-dimensional embeddings of each word. TruncatedSVD returns U*S, so we need to normalize the returned vectors, so that all the vectors will appear around the unit circle (therefore closeness is directional closeness). Note: The line of code below that does the normalizing uses the NumPy concept of broadcasting. If you don't know about broadcasting, check out Computation on Arrays: Broadcasting by Jake VanderPlas.\n",
